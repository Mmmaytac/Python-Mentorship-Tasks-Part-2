# Python-Mentorship-Tasks-Part-2

### Overview

This repository contains the second part of the Python mentorship materials, covering topics from 10 to 16. This stage focuses on advancing students’ programming skills and deepening their understanding of Python concepts introduced earlier.

The tasks in this section are more analytical and require structured problem-solving approaches.

### Content Description

The later topics include more advanced programming concepts, deeper work with data structures, function design, and more complex logical challenges. Students were expected to apply foundational knowledge while solving multi-step problems.

This part emphasizes writing cleaner, more efficient, and logically structured code while strengthening debugging skills and analytical reasoning.

### Teaching Philosophy

In this phase of mentorship, the goal was not only to teach syntax but to develop computational thinking. The exercises were designed to simulate real-world logic scenarios and improve students’ confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems independently.
